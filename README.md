Aetherfeed is a spiritual successor to the now-shutdown xivplugins.com, providing a searchable feed of FFXIV plugins.

## How it works

The plugin list (`plugins.json`) is automatically updated every 6 hours by a separate scraper repository that monitors GitHub for FFXIV plugins. It validates repositories and aggregates the data displayed here.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This list is largely generated automatically and is NOT manually audited.**

*   **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
*   Plugins listed here may contain malware, viruses, or malicious code.
*   Always understand what you are installing.
*   This list includes closed-source and obfuscated plugins.
*   If you use custom repositories found here, **DO NOT** ask for help on the official Dalamud/XIVLauncher Discord server.
