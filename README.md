# Aetherfeed - [Live Site](https://beslightly.github.io/aetherfeed/)

Aetherfeed was made as a spiritual successor of xivplugins.com, which unfortunately has been shut down. </br>
I'm not a programmer myself, 99% of code was generated using Gemini 2.5 and Claude.


## How does it work?

Every 12 hours a github action looks for repositories that might contain plugins and then proceeds to validate them. </br>
The closed-source information, some repositories and minor description changes were done by hand.


## ⚠️ Warning

Like the warning on the site says: **This list is largly generated automatically**, plugins listed might contain malware or get you banned. </br>
*   **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
*   Understand what you're installing.
*   This list includes plugins that are closed-source and obfuscated. 
*   If you use custom repos, **DO NOT** ask for help on the official Dalamud/XIVLauncher discord server.
